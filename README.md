# Dynamic-CV
This LaTeX code will create a modern CV in PDF dynamically fetching CSV data from Google Sheets. On Google Sheets, one can toggle rows on and off (checkboxes) to show or hide them on the CV. I created this for myself so currently there is only one style, but the sections are customizable. Each CV section gets data from a separate CSV file.
