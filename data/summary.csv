"I am a student with a geoscience background committed to develop a creative and agile engineering mindset in Aerospace Engineering. Fascinated about the Moon, Mars and ""the pale blue dot"" and orbital/interplanetary travel, I am very motivated to understand them better and contribute to the design, construction, testing and operation of modern spacecraft to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond. I am convinced that advances in Aerospace will ultimately benefit the humanity at large.","Subsystems: GNC, RCS, Systems Engineering;Engineering tools: CAD, CAM, Controls, Firmware, MAIT;Missions: Human Planetary Exploration, In-situ Resource Utilization on the Moon and Mars"
